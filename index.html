                    <p class="about-us-history-paragraph">Floristry has become a huge industry not just in the UK, but
                        around the world. Floristry is no
                        longer just a hobby, but an occupation too. Consider how many flower bouquets are purchased on
                        special occasions throughout the year; birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day
                        and more.In fact, the floristry industry is believed to be worth a staggering £1.5bn and if you
                        want a
                        slice of the action, this resource has been created to provide an overview of the industry as a
                        whole. With over 7,000 floristry businesses countrywide and bouquets available online.
                        <br><br>Their skills and expertise should allow them to form arrangements for wreaths,
                        bouquets, vases and large centrepieces. In a non-commercial aspect, florists can also fill rooms
                        and outdoor areas for competitions and flower shows. Of course, these could also be appropriate
                        for large weddings and events.
                        There are specialist designs and floral formations florists can choose to use, whilst others
                        will have their own patterns to rely on. Of course, offering a bespoke display to customers can
                        be a great USP and will also earn more for the florist.
